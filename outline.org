**** Some of the Clojure basics
**** Clojure's built in test framework (clojure.test)
**** Java interop
**** Polymorphism
**** Macros
**** Contrib libraries
**** Leiningen
*** Why Clojure?
*** Surely a Clojure adapter for Redis already exists!
**** That's not the point, this is about learning
** All about Redis
*** Short explanation
**** Why it is a great example
**** Explain the unified protocol
** Getting Started

*** Hell no, we abstract!
*** An introduction to macros in Clojure
*** Defining a language for describing command functions
*** Writing the macros that pull it all together
